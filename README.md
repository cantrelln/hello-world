Hello World! 
I have recently, as in about 6 mths, started learning python.
I am 38, married father of 2.
My day job, which is sometimes night, evening, early or late morning job, is a Ready Mix Driver.
Which is concrete dilivery CDL driving and leave very little time to code.
I fill my spare time at work or while driving immersing my self in programing via podcast and YouTube.
I started coding using "codeing with mosh" 8 hr youtube video to see if something would stick. It kinda did so i purchased his 
corse and later zed shaw LPTHW. 
I try to study and code at night up to going to bed.
Apparently I lack spelling skills lol
This font is hard to see as well with flux softwear as well as BLB on (Blue Light Blockers)
Im also interested in health, fitness, and Biohacking. 
and think ive typed long enough now
